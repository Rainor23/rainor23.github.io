<p>LLMNR - The link-local multicast name resolution. A protocol with a similar function as that of NetBIOS (Outdated) and generally, is used as a replacement. 
LLMNR and NetBIOS allow name resolution for devices on the network, essentially - DNS type function, without needing DNS configuration. As LLMNR sends its requists via broadcast packets, it is possible to intercept them and perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.</p>
